Part 1.2. Testing (25%):

Create an additional class for testing K (example: MyHashTable<MyTestingClass, Student> table = new MyHashTable<>();)

Create your own hashCode() method in MyTestingClass (You are not allowed to use default hashing methods like Objects.hash())

Add random 10000 elements to your hashtable and print number of elements in each bucket (chain or linkedlist).

Tune your hashCode method in MyTestingClass so that it does not violate the uniform distribution.



Part 2.1. Implement following Binary Search Tree class (25%). 




Part 2.2. (25%)
